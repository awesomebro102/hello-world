--------------------------------------------------The Battle of the Bloody Skulls---------------------------------------------------
Grummush the Heated rose from his slumber.
He was the overlord of an entire orc tribe, yet he was dissatisfied by his position.
He had killed and tortured his way to the top, and now that fun was gone.
None had rose to challenge him, or attempt to sabotage his fortress.
He was unfeeling, in all the bad ways.
His warchiefs were all spread out in a foolish campaign against humans.
He hoped some human prisoners might make his life interesting again.
He gazed upon his fortress as Ozymandias would, a king of kings.
His first thought of torture came to mind.
He would capture the other overlords, torture them, and maim them.
In the end, he, Grummush the Heated, an Olog, would rule all of the Orcs.
