--------------------------------------------------The Battle of the Bloody Skulls---------------------------------------------------
Grummush the Heated rose from his slumber.
He was the overlord of an entire orc tribe, yet he was dissatisfied by his position.
He had killed and tortured his way to the top, and now that fun was gone.
None had rose to challenge him, or attempt to sabotage his fortress.
He was unfeeling, in all the bad ways.
His warchiefs were all spread out in a foolish campaign against humans.
He hoped some human prisoners might make his life interesting again.
He gazed upon his fortress as Ozymandias would, a king of kings.
His first thought of torture came to mind.
He would capture the other overlords, torture them, and maim them.
In the end, he, Grummush the Heated, an Olog, would rule all of the Orcs.
-------------------------------------------------The Machine Tirbe Discussion-------------------------------------------------------
"I ask you to surrender before this becomes bloody!" Grummush yelled at Krimlak.
"Hell no. Perhaps for that, I should feed you to the machine, yet I don't think I will. Pushkrimp!"
A Machine Wachief flung a hook at Grummush, but Grummush caught it.
"I WILL KILL!!!" Grummush flew into a frenzy, grabbed the hook and stabbed Pushkrimp with it.
He sprinted over and began hacking at Krimlak with the bloody Machine hook.
One shot struck Krimlak's skull and he died on the spot, his own hook lodged in his brain.
Grummush went out onto the balcony, where he gazed upon the destruction he left in his wake.
"Machine orcs! Hear me! This fortress belongs to me, the Bloody Skulls! You are now part of our tribe! If you rebel, I shall relish in your
torture and maiming! Keep your overlord's head! It shall be on a spike at the fortress gates."
Grummush threw the head of Krimlak to Krimlak's own followers.
He had conquered the Machine orcs, the first of many tribes left free.
------------------------------------------------The Heores of Legend-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nrimbor was sleeping as he went across the countryside.
He was in no hurry, for he just killed Tiamat, the queen of dragons, and saved the coast.
Suddenly, an arrow flew from a nearby bush, and missed his wolf.
He woke suddenly, and shot into the bushes, hitting something.
An orc fell down, and several more ran out of the bushes, then stopped.
"Well, well, well. If it isn't Nrimbor, the slayer of dragons. How are you?"
The orc was different, a captain.
