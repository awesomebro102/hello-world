# The Hoard of The Dragon Queen
The air shook around Tiamat's wings, propelling her forward.
She gazed upon her work, if only for a moment.
An old human poem came to her mind,"'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'".
For she was Ozymandias, and her kingdom was gone, replaced by the walls of the nine hells holding her in here.
She had devised an escape, yet it was far away.
The Cult of Dragons shall soon save the day.
Tiamat will grow, and devour the world.
Only four adventurers, a barbarian, a fighter, a ranger, and a warlock, can stop her hunger.
They will reclaim the world for the races of men, elves, and dwarves.
It shall be the hardest battle of all time.
It shall usher in the Rise of Tiamat.
