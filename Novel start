# The Hoard of The Dragon Queen
The air shook around Tiamat's wings, propelling her forward.
She gazed upon her work, if only for a moment.
An old human poem came to her mind,"'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'".
For she was Ozymandias, and her kingdom was gone, replaced by the walls of the nine hells holding her in here.
She had devised an escape, yet it was far away.
The Cult of Dragons shall soon save the day.
Tiamat will grow, and devour the world.
Only four adventurers, a barbarian, a fighter, a ranger, and a warlock, can stop her hunger.
They will reclaim the world for the races of men, elves, and dwarves.
It shall be the hardest battle of all time.
It shall usher in the Rise of Tiamat.
----------------------------------------Chapter 1-----------------------------------------
On-Kung, Nrimbor, Celebrimbor, and Torvin were escorting a caravan being paid 10 gp an hour, plus 200 gp bonus and 500 gp per attack repelled.
It looks like they won't get that bonus.
"Come on, just let me attack it!" Torvin said,"At least we'll get 500 bonus each!"
"No, Torvin," Nrimbor said through a sigh,"We must be honest."
Nrimbor was a ranger with a speciality crossbow and a wolf mount.
Torvin wasn't exactly right of mind, being a barbarian and all, he saw his brother killed by a legendary beast, and still has the scars.
Celebrimbor was an impropable brother of the halfing Nrimbor, being an elf and all.
On-Kung tries to help humanity and elfvish-kind, as he is a half-elf warlock.
"My wolf smells a dragon!" Nrimbor cried in disbelief,"A damned blue dragon, at Greenest!"
"I shall scout ahead," Celebrimbor yelled, almost 200 feet ahead of everyone,"I shall return with a report!"
He was not gone but 5 minutes when he returned with horrible news.
